P4Descript: A suite of efficiency tools for virtual meetings projecting $14 million in revenue by 2023 that my team and I create in Infosys' annual intern hackathon, InStep Hacks, and won 1st place! Users of our application are given an allowance to schedule meetings and each user has a cost correlated with their company title. Before a meeting, hosts have the option to add modules to keep participation and efficiency high. After the meeting, users can see meeting analytics that shows, for example, who was the most active and the optimal length of the meeting. Users are also awarded badges for their positive contributions to a meeting.
