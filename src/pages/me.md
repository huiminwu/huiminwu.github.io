At MIT, I'm majoring in computer science (6-3), and expecting to graduate in June 2023. I love learning and taking on new and exciting projects! This summer, I am interning at Infosys on the cybersecurity development team! Besides computer science, some of my hobbies include ballroom dancing, glassmaking, and board games.
