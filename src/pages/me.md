At MIT, I'm majoring in computer science (6-3), and expecting to graduate in June 2023. I love learning and taking on new and exciting projects! Currently, I'm a lab assistant for MIT's largest data structures and algorithms course, with over 500 students (6.009)! Besides computer science, some of my hobbies include ballroom dancing, glassmaking, and board games.
