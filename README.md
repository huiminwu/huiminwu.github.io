# Hui Min Wu's website

[Visit Here!](https://huiminwu.github.io)

Note: Since the website deploys from master, the actual source code for the website is currently on my develop branch!

For this website, I used
 - Gatsby.js
 - Node.js
 - styled-components
 - typography
 - markdown
 - GraphQL

Things I have yet to do:
  - [ ] Add animation for clickable logos
  - [ ] Add page transition animations
  - [ ] Add animation hovering over tech logos
  - [ ] Organize code a lot better
