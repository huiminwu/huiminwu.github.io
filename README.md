# Development branch of my personal website

[Website](https://www.huiminwu.github.io)

For this website, I used
 - Gatsby.js
 - Node.js
 - styled-components
 - typography
 - markdown
 - GraphQL

Things I have yet to do:
  - [ ] Add animation for clickable logos
  - [ ] Add page transition animations
  - [ ] Add animation hovering over tech logos
  - [ ] Organize code a lot better
